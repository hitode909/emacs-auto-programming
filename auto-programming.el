;;; Commentary:

;; How To Use
;;
;; Write some code and execute `auto-programming`.
;; You will get candidates of next line of your program.
;;
;; How It Works
;;
;; For example, when you write `(defun` and execute `auto-programming`,
;; 1. git grep (defun
;; 2. Collect the result of git grep
;; 3. Show the result in editor
;; 4. Replace the current line with the selected result
;; 5. Do same thing for the selected result

;;; Code:

(require 'popup)

(defun auto-programming:root ()
  (expand-file-name (concat (find-lisp-object-file-name 'auto-programming 'defun) "/../")))

(defun auto-programming:candidates (script word)
  (split-string-and-unquote (shell-command-to-string (format "michizane %s %s" script (shell-quote-argument word))) "\n")
  )

(defun auto-programming:select (candidates)
  (popup-menu*
   candidates
   :scroll-bar t
   )
  )

(defun auto-programming ()
  (interactive)
  (let* (
         (word (replace-regexp-in-string "^\\s-+\\|\n+" "" (thing-at-point 'line)))
         (candidates (auto-programming:candidates "horizontal" word))
         )
    (if candidates
        (let (
              (selected-word (auto-programming:select candidates))
              )
          (when selected-word
            (delete-backward-char (length word))
            (insert selected-word)
            (auto-programming:vertical)
            )
          )
      (auto-programming:vertical)
      )
    )
  )

(defun auto-programming:vertical ()
  (interactive)
  (let* (
         (word (replace-regexp-in-string "^\\s-+\\|\n+" "" (thing-at-point 'line)))
         (candidates (auto-programming:candidates "vertical" word))
         )
    (if candidates
        (let (
              (selected-word (auto-programming:select candidates))
              )
          (when selected-word
            (newline-and-indent)
            (insert selected-word)
            (auto-programming:vertical)
            )
          )
